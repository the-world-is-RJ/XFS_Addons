I'm RJ and I've been playing/creating board games since I first knew how to read. Ths is a repository of all of my custom characters for the Exceed Fighting System, also known as Guilty Gear Strive: The Board Game.

## How to Use
Please join [The Breakfast Club](https://discord.gg/4sSptGt6W9v) on Discord to access playable .jsons of these characters conveniently and easily (as well as so I can receive feedback for them)!
As for the Exceed Fighting System, it's all over the place and the earliest sets are incredibly difficult to track down. You can get help locating where to buy boxes of the game in the server linked above, or play the Tabletop Simulator mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1430620409&searchtext=xfs).
